### To-Do List App

This is a simple Python project that I created to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application offers a straightforward text-based interface where users can add tasks, view a list of all tasks, and delete tasks as needed. It's designed to be user-friendly and provides immediate feedback on the actions performed.

#### Features
- **Add Task:** Allows users to input and add tasks to their to-do list.
- **View Tasks:** Displays all current tasks, numbering them for easy reference.
- **Delete Task:** Enables users to remove tasks from the list by entering the task number.

#### How to Use
1. **Start the application:** Run the script, and the main menu will be displayed.
2. **Choose an option:** Input the number corresponding to your choice (Add, View, Delete, or Exit).
3. **Follow prompts:** The app will guide you through adding or deleting tasks with prompts for necessary inputs.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x

This app is perfect for anyone looking for a basic, no-frills tool to keep track of daily tasks. It operates entirely from the command line, making it lightweight and portable. Enjoy organizing your tasks with ease using the To-Do List App!
